Minimalist FBI Crime Data API Wrapper, meant primarily for personal use with a future project, but shared publicly so that others can also use it.

Fulfills most if not all of the functionality found here: https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api
Also extends some additional functionality that might be helpful.

Do not expect maintenance.
